<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/hero.gif" width="500px" />
</p>

A utility for creating a pan gesture that auto-selects items in a list, like your favorite gallery app.

- Supports Android & iOS
- Handles scrolling
- Super performant
- Headless API: Bring your own UI
- Works with typical scrollable views - [`ScrollView`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview), [`FlatList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist), [`FlashList`](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/) etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> If something is not working as it's supposed to, let me know by submitting an issue. I'm finalizing the initial API and on the lookout for edge cases before releasing v1.0.0

## Usage

### Quickstart

This package is made with [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated) & [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler), and using it requires some familiarity.

`useDragSelect` is a utility hook. It works by taking in parameters describing the UI of your list and returns managed gestures.

Paste this snippet into your project to get started.

```tsx
import { useDragSelect } from "@osamaq/drag-select"

import { FlatList, View, Text } from "react-native"
import { GestureDetector } from "react-native-gesture-handler"
import Animated, { useAnimatedRef, useAnimatedScrollHandler } from "react-native-reanimated"

function List() {
  const data = Array.from({ length: 50 }).map((_, index) => ({
    id: `usr_${index}`,
    name: "foo",
  }))

  const flatlist = useAnimatedRef<FlatList<(typeof data)[number]>>()

  const { gestures, onScroll } = useDragSelect({
    data,
    key: "id",
    list: {
      animatedRef: flatlist,
      numColumns: 2,
      itemSize: { height: 50, width: 50 },
    },
    onItemSelected: (id, index) => {
      console.log("onItemSelected", { id, index })
    },
    onItemDeselected: (id, index) => {
      console.log("onItemDeselected", { id, index })
    },
    onItemPress: (id, index) => {
      console.log("onItemPress", { id, index })
    },
  })

  const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({ onScroll })

  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={gestures.panHandler}>
      <Animated.FlatList
        data={data}
        ref={flatlist}
        numColumns={2}
        onScroll={scrollHandler}
        renderItem={({ item, index }) => (
          <GestureDetector gesture={gestures.createItemPressHandler(item.id, index)}>
            <View style={{ width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: "salmon" }}>
              <Text>{item.id}</Text>
            </View>
          </GestureDetector>
        )}
      />
    </GestureDetector>
  )
}
```

### Step-by-step

#### 1. Create a list

- The list component must be [animated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/core/createAnimatedComponent)
- To use autoscrolling, the component must support [`scrollTo`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/scroll/scrollTo/#remarks)

<details>
<summary><strong>Show code</strong></summary>

```tsx
import Animated from "react-native-reanimated"
import { Text, View } from "react-native"

export function List() {
  const data = Array.from({ length: 50 }).map((_, index) => ({
    id: `usr_${index}`,
    name: "foo",
  }))

  return (
    <Animated.ScrollView>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <View key={item.id}>
          <Text>{item.id}</Text>
        </View>
      ))}
    </Animated.ScrollView>
  )
}
```
</details>

#### 2. Style it

When styling your list, parameters like item size and column gap must be specified in plain numbers.

- Avoid relative parameters for item size e.g. `width: "25%"`
- When positioning items, avoid properties like `justifyContent`. Instead, specify column/row gap and padding

That is because we will be passing those parameters to `useDragSelect` and actual item size or location is never measured internally.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show code</strong></summary>

```tsx
const { width: windowWidth } = Dimensions.get("window")

const numColumns = 2
const rowGap = 50
const columnGap = 50

const paddingHorizontal = 24
const listWidth = windowWidth - paddingHorizontal * 2

const itemWidth = (listWidth - columnGap * (numColumns - 1)) / numColumns
const itemHeight = 50
```

The list layout on the other hand is measured once per pan gesture, which is why we have to pass an [animated ref](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/core/useAnimatedRef/) to the hook.

```tsx
// ...
  const scrollView = useAnimatedRef<Animated.ScrollView>()

  useDragSelect({
    data,
    key: "id",
    list: {
      animatedRef: scrollView,
      columnGap,
      rowGap,
      itemSize: { height: itemHeight, width: itemWidth },
      contentInset: {
        right: paddingHorizontal,
        left: paddingHorizontal,
      },
    },
  })

  return (
    <Animated.ScrollView
      ref={scrollView}
      style={{
        rowGap,
        columnGap,
        paddingHorizontal,
        flexGrow: 1,
        flexDirection: "row",
        flexWrap: "wrap",
      }}
    >
      {data.map((item) => (
        <View
          key={item.id}
          style={{
            width: itemWidth,
            height: itemHeight,
          }}
        >
          <Text>{item.id}</Text>
        </View>
      ))}
    </Animated.ScrollView>
  )
```
</details>

#### 3. Register events

While `useDragSelect` manages gestures for us, we still have to register them. Create [`GestureDetector`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/gestures/gesture-detector/)'s wrapping the list and each item and a [scroll event handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/scroll/useAnimatedScrollHandler/).

- Long pressing an item activates 'selection mode'
- A long press followed by a pan gesture selects items
- In 'selection mode', tapping an item selects it

<details>
<summary><strong>Show code</strong></summary>

```tsx
  const { gestures, onScroll } = useDragSelect(...)

  const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({ onScroll })

  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={gestures.panHandler}>
      <Animated.ScrollView
        onScroll={scrollHandler}
        ref={...}
        style={...}
      >
        {data.map((item, index) => (
          <GestureDetector
            key={item.id}
            gesture={gestures.createItemPressHandler(item.id, index)}
          >
            <View style={...}>
              <Text>{item.id}</Text>
            </View>
          </GestureDetector>
        ))}
      </Animated.ScrollView>
    </GestureDetector>
  )
```
</details>

#### 4. Build the rest ðŸ¦‰

The rest is up to you!

> [!TIP]
> - Use methods on the `selection` object to imperatively `add`, `delete` or `clear` items from the JS thread
> - Use `selection.items` to drive animations with Reanimated

## Performance

Running this utility is not inherently expensive. It works by doing some math on every [frame update](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/advanced/useFrameCallback/) and only when panning the list. In my testing, I could not manage to get any frame drops at this point. However...

Performance cost comes from the additional logic added in response to changes in selection. You can easily cause frame drops by running expensive animations.

> [!TIP]
> Try to be conservative in list item animations on selection change.
>
> - Certain components and properties are more costly to animate than others
> - Don't animate too many things at once

## Currently Not Supported

- Horizontal lists
- Inverted lists
- Lists with dynamic item size
- Scroll view [zoom](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#zoomscale-ios)
- Section lists

## Known Issues

- **Android, new architecture**: In the new architecture, automatic scrolling will lead to the app hanging with an ANR notification. This appears to be a bug with React Native which is [fixed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/44725) in 0.77+

## Development

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev start
```

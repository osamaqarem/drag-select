# ðŸ‘† Drag Select for React Native

<pre></pre>

A utility for creating a pan gesture that auto-selects items in a list, like your favorite gallery app.

- Supports Android & iOS
- Handles scrolling
- Super performant
- Headless API: Bring your own UI
- Works with typical scrollable views - [`ScrollView`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview), [`FlatList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist), [`FlashList`](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/) etc.

## Usage

This package is made with [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated) & [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler), and using it requires some familiarity.

`useDragSelect` is a utility hook. It works by taking in parameters describing the UI of your list and returns managed gestures.

It's important to specify list config parameters correctly as actual item size and location is never measured.

```tsx
import { useDragSelect } from "@osamaq/drag-select"

import { View, Text } from "react-native"
import { GestureDetector } from "react-native-gesture-handler"
import Animated, { useAnimatedRef, useAnimatedScrollHandler } from "react-native-reanimated"

function List() {
  const data = [{ id: "usr_123", name: "foo" }]

  const flatlist = useAnimatedRef()

  const { gestures, onScroll } = useDragSelect({
    data,
    key: "id",
    list: {
      columnSeparatorWidth: 0,
      rowSeparatorHeight: 30,
      animatedRef: flatlist,
      itemSize: { height: 50, width: 50 },
    },
  })

  const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({ onScroll })

  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={gestures.panHandler}>
      <Animated.FlatList
        data={data}
        ItemSeparatorComponent={<View style={{ height: 30 }} />}
        onScroll={scrollHandler}
        renderItem={({ item, index }) => (
          <GestureDetector gesture={gestures.createItemPressHandler(item, index)}>
            <View style={{ width: 50, height: 50 }}>
              <Text>{item.id}</Text>
            </View>
          </GestureDetector>
        )}
      />
    </GestureDetector>
  )
}
```

## Installation

## Recipes

TODO

## Performance

Running this utility is not inherently expensive. It works by doing some math on every [frame update](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/advanced/useFrameCallback/) and only when panning the list. In my testing, I could not manage to get any frame drops at this point. However...

Performance cost comes from the additional logic added in response to changes in selection. You can easily cause frame drops by running expensive animations.

> [!TIP]
> Try to be conservative in list item animations on selection change.
>
> - Certain components and properties are more costly to animate than others
> - Don't animate too many things at once

## Currently Not Supported

- Horizontal lists
- Inverted lists
- Lists with dynamic item size
- Section lists

Most would be possible to support, except lists with dynamic item size. I'm not sure drag-to-select would make sense there, and the key performance principle of this library is avoiding item measurements.

## Known Issues

- **Android, new architecture**: In the new architecture, automatic scrolling will lead to the app hanging with an ANR notification. This appears to be a bug with React Native which has been [fixed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/44725) in 0.77+

## Development

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev start
```

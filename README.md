<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/hero.gif" width="500px" />
</p>

A utility for creating a pan gesture that auto-selects items in a list, like your favorite gallery app.

- Supports Android & iOS
- Handles scrolling
- Super performant
- Headless API: Bring your own UI
- Works with typical scrollable views - [`ScrollView`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview), [`FlatList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist), [`FlashList`](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/) etc.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package requires [Reanimated v3](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#installation) and [Gesture Handler v2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation/).

```sh
npm install @osamaq/drag-select
```

```sh
yarn add @osamaq/drag-select
```

```sh
pnpm add @osamaq/drag-select
```

## Usage

### Quickstart

This package is made with [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated) & [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler), and using it requires some familiarity.

`useDragSelect` is a utility hook. It works by taking in parameters describing the UI of your list and returns managed gestures.

Paste this snippet into your project to get started.

```tsx
import { useDragSelect } from "@osamaq/drag-select"

import { FlatList, View, Text } from "react-native"
import { GestureDetector } from "react-native-gesture-handler"
import Animated, { useAnimatedRef, useAnimatedScrollHandler } from "react-native-reanimated"

function List() {
  const data = Array.from({ length: 50 }).map((_, index) => ({
    id: `usr_${index}`,
    name: "foo",
  }))

  const flatlist = useAnimatedRef<FlatList<(typeof data)[number]>>()

  const { gestures, onScroll } = useDragSelect({
    data,
    key: "id",
    list: {
      animatedRef: flatlist,
      numColumns: 2,
      itemSize: { height: 50, width: 50 },
    },
    onItemSelected: (id, index) => {
      console.log("onItemSelected", { id, index })
    },
    onItemDeselected: (id, index) => {
      console.log("onItemDeselected", { id, index })
    },
    onItemPress: (id, index) => {
      console.log("onItemPress", { id, index })
    },
  })

  const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({ onScroll })

  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={gestures.panHandler}>
      <Animated.FlatList
        data={data}
        ref={flatlist}
        numColumns={2}
        onScroll={scrollHandler}
        renderItem={({ item, index }) => (
          <GestureDetector gesture={gestures.createItemPressHandler(item.id, index)}>
            <View style={{ width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: "salmon" }}>
              <Text>{item.id}</Text>
            </View>
          </GestureDetector>
        )}
      />
    </GestureDetector>
  )
}
```

## Performance

Running this utility is not inherently expensive. It works by doing some math on every [frame update](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/advanced/useFrameCallback/) and only when panning the list. In my testing, I could not manage to get any frame drops at this point. However...

Performance cost comes from the additional logic added in response to changes in selection. You can easily cause frame drops by running expensive animations.

> [!TIP]
> Try to be conservative in list item animations on selection change.
>
> - Certain components and properties are more costly to animate than others
> - Don't animate too many things at once

## Currently Not Supported

- Inverted lists
- Lists with dynamic item size
- Scroll view [zoom](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#zoomscale-ios)
- Section lists

## Known Issues

- **Android, new architecture**: In the new architecture, automatic scrolling will lead to the app hanging with an ANR notification. This appears to be a bug with React Native which is [fixed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/44725) in 0.77+

## Development

This project uses pnpm. You can install it [here](https://pnpm.io/installation) or through [Corepack](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-use-corepack).

```sh
# install dependencies and start the dev app server
pnpm install
pnpm dev start
```
